# todo-app

This project consists of a To-Do list app that allows users to:

#Add a new task. 

- It should be at least 3-character long and contain valid characters: letters and numbers, not just numbers only. Otherwise, a window will pop up. 
- If the field is empty, a message window will pop up.

#Remove task: The task disappears from the list.

#Mark completed tasks: The task is shown as strikenthrough.

#Active: Shows only pending tasks.

#Completed: Shows only completed tasks.

#Clear Completed: Hides completed tasks from the list.

#Clear All: Hides all tasks from the list.

#Task counter: Shows number of active tasks. The number diminishes as tasks get completed.
